Bar codes usually consist of 13 digits eg 9425674564783. 
The first two digits give the country of origin, the next 5 the manufacturer, the next 5 give the product code. 
The last digit is used as a check digit.  
		○ Write a program where the user inputs a bar code 
		○ The program checks that it is 13 digits long : len()
		○ It then lists the country code, the manufacturer’s code, the product code and the check digit (you can Google some of these, or make them up) 
		○ If the barcode does not have 13 digits, there should be an error message.
